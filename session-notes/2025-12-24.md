## Completed This Session

### Hero Banner Body Text - Fixed 5-Line Layout

**Requirement:** Body text should maintain exactly 5 lines with specific words starting each line, scaling proportionally as the screen size changes without reflowing.

**Line starts:**
1. "Empowering"
2. "pregnancy,"
3. "understand"
4. "wellness,"
5. "for"

**Implementation:**
- Added `<br>` tags after each line in HTML for explicit line breaks
- Added `white-space: nowrap` to CSS to prevent text from reflowing
- Changed font-size to `clamp(0.5rem, 1.4vw, 1rem)` for proportional viewport-based scaling
- Removed `text-align: justify` and `max-width` constraints

**Final HTML:**
```html
<p class="hero-banner-body">
  Empowering women in preconception,<br>
  pregnancy, and postpartum to<br>
  understand their bodies, simplify<br>
  wellness, + create a healthy home<br>
  for themselves and their families.
</p>
```

**Final CSS:**
```css
/* Container max-width changed from 750px to 65vw for proportional scaling */
.hero-banner-headline-top {
  max-width: 65vw;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

.hero-banner-content {
  max-width: 65vw;
}

.hero-banner-body {
  font-family: 'Glacial Indifference', 'Poppins', var(--font-body);
  font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.4vw, 1rem);
  font-weight: 400;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.15em;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: var(--color-charcoal);
  margin-bottom: 1.2em;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

**Key changes:**
- Changed container `max-width` from fixed `750px` to viewport-based `65vw`
- This makes the entire banner scale proportionally with the viewport
- Combined with `white-space: nowrap`, lines stay fixed while the whole unit scales

### "HI! I'M ALICIA" Section Updates

- Reduced title font size
- Changed photo to `/images/about/alicia-portrait-mug.jpg`
- Reduced spacing between title ("HI! I'M ALICIA") and subtitle ("nurse practitioner | wellness educator | mom")

### HTMA Educational Landing Page

**New Page:** `/htma.html` - Dedicated HTMA educational and conversion-optimized landing page

**Features:**
- Hero section with value proposition
- "What is HTMA?" educational section with detailed explanation
- 4-stage journey cards (Collect → Analyze → Interpret → Apply)

- Benefits grid with icons

**Styling:**

**Navigation Integration:**
All site pages now include "What is HTMA?" link in:
- Desktop Services dropdown (first item)
- Mobile navigation menu

**Pages Updated (16 total):**
- `/index.html`
- `/about.html`
- `/contact.html`
- `/blog/index.html`
- `/blog/post.html`
- `/blog/post-superior.html`
- `/services/htma-consulting.html`
- `/services/htma-consulting-v2.html`
- `/services/lab-review.html`
- `/services/lab-review-v2.html`
- `/services/intentional-reset.html`

- `/legal/terms.html`
- `/apply.html`
- `/drafts/about-v2.html`

**Homepage HTMA Card:** Updated to link directly to `/htma.html` instead of services page

### Internal Linking Strategy Added to CLAUDE.md

Added guidance for proactively offering internal links in blog posts to service pages:
- Link HTMA-related content → `/htma.html`
- Link lab/blood work content → `/services/lab-review.html`
- Link wellness/hormone content → `/services/htma-consulting.html`
- Link getting started content → `/apply.html` or `/contact.html`

This helps convert blog readers into clients by guiding them to relevant services.

### Internal Linking Audit Added to SEO Guide

Added comprehensive internal linking audit section to `/session-notes/SEO-AIO-Marketing-Guide.md`:
- **50+ linking opportunities** identified across all pages
- Blog posts have ZERO internal links (biggest gap)
- Specific anchor text recommendations for each of 7 blog posts
- Service page cross-linking recommendations
- CTA hierarchy: Learn More → Apply (HTMA/1:1 require application)
- Implementation checklist for post-approval execution

**Key insight:** "Your Body Is the First Home" blog post explicitly mentions HTMA but doesn't link to `/htma.html` - high-priority fix.

### HTMA Page Refinements (8 Fixes)

   - Benefits grid: 8 icons (balance, thyroid, chart, lightning, calm, shield, brain, refresh)
   - Research cards: Building, heart, star, flask icons
   - Comparison card: Camera (blood tests) and chart (HTMA) icons
   - Quiz result: Sparkle icon

3. **CTA Section Colors** - Fixed "Ready to Understand" section:
   - Changed from dark charcoal gradient to solid sage background
   - Improved button contrast (white button with sage text)
   - Better readability with white text on sage background

4. **Section Headers** - Already matched `.ir-styled-title`:
   - Playfair Display italic, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.08em

5. **What is HTMA Image** - Replaced comparison card:
   - Replaced Blood Tests vs HTMA card with homepage HTMA image
   - New image: `/images/services/htma.webp`
   - Added `.htma-intro-image` styling (rounded corners, shadow)

6. **Quiz Checkboxes** - Enhanced styling:
   - Added min-width/min-height for visibility
   - Added fallback colors for CSS variables
   - Improved checkmark styling with CSS-only checkmark

7. **Process Timeline Numbers** - Matched Intentional Reset styling:
   - Changed from 60px sage circles to 50px charcoal (#4A4B49) circles
   - Updated font-weight to 700, adjusted timeline line position

8. **Hero Section Photo** - Added uploaded laptop photo:

## Notes

- The `white-space: nowrap` approach ensures text lines stay exactly as designed regardless of viewport width
- The `clamp()` function provides proportional scaling: minimum 0.5rem, preferred 1.4vw, maximum 1rem
- This technique maintains the visual layout while being fully responsive
