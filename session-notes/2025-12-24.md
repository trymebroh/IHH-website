## Completed This Session

### Hero Banner Body Text - Fixed 5-Line Layout

**Requirement:** Body text should maintain exactly 5 lines with specific words starting each line, scaling proportionally as the screen size changes without reflowing.

**Line starts:**
1. "Empowering"
2. "pregnancy,"
3. "understand"
4. "wellness,"
5. "for"

**Implementation:**
- Added `<br>` tags after each line in HTML for explicit line breaks
- Added `white-space: nowrap` to CSS to prevent text from reflowing
- Changed font-size to `clamp(0.5rem, 1.4vw, 1rem)` for proportional viewport-based scaling
- Removed `text-align: justify` and `max-width` constraints

**Final HTML:**
```html
<p class="hero-banner-body">
  Empowering women in preconception,<br>
  pregnancy, and postpartum to<br>
  understand their bodies, simplify<br>
  wellness, + create a healthy home<br>
  for themselves and their families.
</p>
```

**Final CSS:**
```css
/* Container max-width changed from 750px to 65vw for proportional scaling */
.hero-banner-headline-top {
  max-width: 65vw;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

.hero-banner-content {
  max-width: 65vw;
}

.hero-banner-body {
  font-family: 'Glacial Indifference', 'Poppins', var(--font-body);
  font-size: clamp(0.5rem, 1.4vw, 1rem);
  font-weight: 400;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.15em;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: var(--color-charcoal);
  margin-bottom: 1.2em;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

**Key changes:**
- Changed container `max-width` from fixed `750px` to viewport-based `65vw`
- This makes the entire banner scale proportionally with the viewport
- Combined with `white-space: nowrap`, lines stay fixed while the whole unit scales

### "HI! I'M ALICIA" Section Updates

- Reduced title font size
- Changed photo to `/images/about/alicia-portrait-mug.jpg`
- Reduced spacing between title ("HI! I'M ALICIA") and subtitle ("nurse practitioner | wellness educator | mom")

## Notes

- The `white-space: nowrap` approach ensures text lines stay exactly as designed regardless of viewport width
- The `clamp()` function provides proportional scaling: minimum 0.5rem, preferred 1.4vw, maximum 1rem
- This technique maintains the visual layout while being fully responsive
