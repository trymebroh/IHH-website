## Completed This Session

### HTMA Educational Landing Page (`/htma.html`)

**New page with V3-style design:**
- Two-column hero (text left, image right) with gradient badge, stats bar overlay
- Title: "What is *Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis?*" (italic span only)
- 4 journey cards with SVG icons (Preconception, Pregnancy, Postpartum, Low-Tox)
- Interactive quiz ("Is HTMA Right for You?") - shows result after 2+ checks
- 8 benefits cards with SVG icons
- Process timeline with charcoal numbered circles
- Research cards with citations
- FAQ accordion
- Sage-colored final CTA section

**SVG Icons:** Replaced all emojis with stroke-based SVG icons (explicit #8B9A82 color)

**Navigation:** Added "What is HTMA?" to Services dropdown on all 16 pages

### Internal Linking Audit

Added to `/session-notes/SEO-AIO-Marketing-Guide.md`:
- 50+ linking opportunities identified
- Blog posts have zero internal links (biggest gap)
- CTA hierarchy: Learn More → Apply (HTMA/1:1 require application)

### Homepage Updates

- Fixed hero body text: 5-line layout with `<br>` tags and `white-space: nowrap`
- Changed "HI! I'M ALICIA" photo to mug version
- HTMA card links to `/htma.html`
