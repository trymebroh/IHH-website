# Session Notes - December 23, 2025

## Summary

This session focused on bug fixes and performance optimization, specifically fixing a JavaScript syntax error that broke blog loading and converting large PNG images to WebP format for significant file size reduction.

---

## Completed This Session

### Bug Fix: Blog Posts Not Loading

**Issue**: Blog posts were not loading on the home page due to a JavaScript syntax error.

**Root Cause**: Escaped backticks (`\``) in the disclaimer fields of blog posts in `/js/blog.js`. The backslash-escaped template literals were invalid JavaScript syntax.

**Fix**: Replaced all 6 instances of `\`` with proper backticks `` ` `` in the disclaimer fields:
- Line 220: `2024-12-01-unmedicated-birth`
- Line 315: `2024-11-15-body-first-home`
- Line 376: `2024-05-15-mental-health-pcos`
- Line 428: `2024-10-15-probiotic-smoothie-bowl`
- Line 508: `2024-10-01-gut-health-pcos`
- Line 571: `2024-09-15-hormone-friendly-granola`

- [ ] Minify JavaScript (Est savings: 4 KiB)
- [ ] Reduce unused CSS (Est savings: 15 KiB)

### Layout/Accessibility Issues

- [ ] Image elements do not have explicit width and height
- [ ] Background/foreground color contrast ratio

### SEO
- [ ] Links do not have descriptive text (3 "LEARN MORE" links)

## New Image Files

| File | Source | Size | Used In |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| `alicia-solution-section.webp` | D08A6123.jpg | 86 KB | HTMA V3 Hero |
| `alicia-better-way.webp` | D08A6224.jpg | 71 KB | HTMA V3 "There's a Better Way" |

---

## Notes

- WebP conversion used quality setting of 85, which provides good balance of quality and file size
- The `smoothie-bowl-cropped.webp` already existed (created in previous session), so only the reference needed updating
- Original PNG files retained as backups until verification complete
- Blog syntax error was likely introduced during a previous editing session where backticks were inadvertently escaped
- ImageMagick installed during session for image cropping/resizing
