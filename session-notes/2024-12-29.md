## Lighthouse Performance & Accessibility Improvements

This session focused on improving Lighthouse scores across multiple pages, targeting both performance and accessibility issues.

## Completed Work

### 1. Blog Index Page (`/blog/index.html`)

**Accessibility Fixes:**
- Changed cookie accept button color from `#8D9488` to `#5d6b5d` for better contrast (4.5:1 ratio)
- Changed footer headings from `<h4>` to `<h3>` to maintain proper heading hierarchy

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Created smaller blog card images (`*-xs.webp` at 300px width) for mobile
- Created `logo-tiny.webp` (1.1KB) for mobile footer
- Added `srcset` to footer logo for responsive loading
- Updated `blog.js` to use srcset for blog card images

---

### 2. Blog Post Pages (`/blog/post.html`, `/blog/post-superior.html`)

**Accessibility Fixes:**
- Changed back-link color from `#8D9488` to `#5d6b5d` in `blog.css` for better contrast
- Changed disclaimer heading from `<h4>` to `<h3>` in `blog.js`
- Changed footer headings from `<h4>` to `<h3>` in both templates

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Created mobile versions of all blog post featured images (~500px wide):

### 3. Lab Review Page (`/services/lab-review.html`)

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Created mobile versions of hero and story images:
  - `horizontal-elements-mobile.webp` (6.5KB vs 31KB - 79% reduction)
  - `alicia-lab-review-story-mobile.webp` (12.7KB vs 52KB - 75% reduction)
- Added `fetchpriority="high"` to mobile hero image (LCP element)
- Added srcset to all images with mobile/desktop variants:
  - Hero image (mobile and desktop versions)
  - Story/solution image (mobile and desktop versions)
- Added responsive preloads with media queries:
  - Mobile: preloads `horizontal-elements-mobile.webp`
  - Desktop: preloads `horizontal-elements.webp`
- Updated header logo with srcset

## Technical Details

### Image Optimization Strategy
- Mobile images created at ~300-500px width using `cwebp -q 80 -resize WIDTH 0`
- Used srcset with width descriptors (e.g., `300w`, `950w`)
- Used sizes attribute to help browser select correct image
- Added `fetchpriority="high"` to LCP images

### Responsive Image Pattern Used
```html
<img src="image.webp"
     srcset="image-mobile.webp 300w, image.webp 950w"
     sizes="(max-width: 767px) 300px, 950px"
     alt="Description" width="950" height="770">
```

### Responsive Preload Pattern Used
```html
<link rel="preload" href="image-mobile.webp" as="image" media="(max-width: 767px)">
<link rel="preload" href="image.webp" as="image" media="(min-width: 768px)">
```

## Expected Improvements

### Performance
- Reduced image payload on mobile by 60-80%
- Faster LCP with appropriate image sizing
- Reduced render-blocking with proper preloads

### Accessibility
- Better color contrast (4.5:1 minimum ratio achieved)
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)

## Pending/Future Work

1. Consider similar optimizations for:
   - Services page (`/services/services.html`)
   - Intentional Reset page (`/services/intentional-reset.html`)
   - About page (`/about.html`)
   - Contact page (`/contact.html`)
   - HTMA page (`/htma.html`)

2. CSS minification could provide additional ~25-33KB savings

3. Consider implementing critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content

## Notes
- All changes pushed to `drafts-website-edits` branch
- User should test locally before merging to main
- Lighthouse scores should be re-run after deployment to verify improvements
