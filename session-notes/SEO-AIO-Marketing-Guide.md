## Executive Summary

Your website has a strong foundation with authentic, valuable content that resonates with your target audience (women navigating preconception, pregnancy, postpartum, and PCOS). This guide provides a roadmap to maximize visibility in both traditional search engines AND AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews).

### The Big Picture
- **SEO** gets you found in Google searches
- **AIO** gets you cited by AI assistants when users ask health questions
- **Both** require the same foundation: authoritative, well-structured, helpful content

### Your Unique Advantages
1. **Credentials**: MSN, APRN, FNP-C - establishes E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
2. **Niche Focus**: Women's holistic health with HTMA specialty
3. **Authentic Voice**: Personal stories create trust and differentiation
4. **Geographic Focus**: Kentucky-specific services reduce competition

## AI Optimization (AIO) Strategy

### Why AIO Matters

AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) are increasingly how people find health information. When someone asks "What minerals should I check before pregnancy?", AI assistants look for:

1. **Authoritative sources** (your credentials matter!)
2. **Well-structured content** (clear headers, organized information)
3. **Direct answers** (not buried in fluff)
4. **Unique perspectives** (your personal experience + clinical background)

### AIO Best Practices

#### 1. Write in Q&A Format
AI assistants love content that directly answers questions. Include FAQ sections and write headers as questions:

**Instead of:** "Benefits of HTMA Testing"
**Write:** "What Can HTMA Testing Tell You About Your Health?"

#### 2. Provide Definitive Statements
AI needs confident, clear answers to cite:

**Weak:** "HTMA might help with understanding minerals."
**Strong:** "HTMA (Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis) measures 35+ minerals and toxic metals from a small hair sample, providing insights into metabolic function, stress response, and nutritional status that blood tests often miss."

#### 3. Include "According to" Phrasing
When referencing research, use language AI can attribute:

"According to research published between 2016-2021, women with PCOS show distinct gut microbiome patterns compared to women without the condition."

#### 4. Create Comprehensive "Ultimate Guides"
AI prefers thorough resources over thin content. Your pillar pages should be 2,500-4,000 words covering a topic completely.

**Recommended Pillar Pages to Create:**
1. "The Complete Guide to HTMA Testing for Women's Health"
2. "PCOS and Holistic Health: Everything You Need to Know"
3. "Preconception Wellness: Preparing Your Body for Pregnancy"
4. "Postpartum Recovery: A Holistic Approach"

#### 5. Add Structured Data (Schema.org)
This is **critical** for AI optimization. Add JSON-LD to every page:

**For Articles:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Your Post Title",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Alicia Harrison",
    "jobTitle": "Family Nurse Practitioner",
    "description": "Board-certified FNP specializing in holistic women's health"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Intention Holistic Health"
  },
  "datePublished": "2025-12-15",
  "dateModified": "2025-12-15"
}
```

**For Your About Page (Person Schema):**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Alicia Harrison",
  "jobTitle": "Family Nurse Practitioner",
  "credential": ["MSN", "APRN", "FNP-C"],
  "alumniOf": "University Name",
  "knowsAbout": ["HTMA", "Women's Health", "PCOS", "Holistic Nutrition"],
  "worksFor": {
    "@type": "MedicalBusiness",
    "name": "Intention Holistic Health"
  }
}
```

**For Services (MedicalBusiness Schema):**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "MedicalBusiness",
  "name": "Intention Holistic Health",
  "description": "Holistic wellness consulting for women",
  "areaServed": "Kentucky",
  "medicalSpecialty": "Holistic Medicine"
}
```

### AIO Content Opportunities

## Internal Linking Audit & Implementation Guide

*Audit completed December 2025*

### Current State
- Navigation menus provide basic cross-linking
- **Blog posts contain NO contextual internal links** (biggest gap)
- Service pages have minimal cross-references
- Homepage sections don't link to related blog content

**50+ internal linking opportunities identified across the site.**

### CTA Hierarchy (Important)

**HTMA and 1:1 services require an application.** The user journey should be:

1. **Learn More First** → Link to educational content
   - `/htma.html` - What is HTMA?
   - Relevant blog posts
   - `/services/htma-consulting.html` - Service details

2. **Then Apply** → `/apply.html`
   - Only after they understand what they're applying for
   - CTAs should read "Apply to Work Together" not "Book Now"

**Example flow in content:**
> "If you're curious about what HTMA can reveal, [learn more about HTMA testing](/htma.html). When you're ready to take the next step, [apply to work together](/apply.html)."

### Priority 1: Blog Post Links (Highest Impact)

2. Use vertical images (1000x1500 pixels optimal)
3. Include text overlay with key benefit
4. Rich pins enabled (requires meta tags)

   - PCOS Tips & Support
   - Hormone Balancing Recipes
   - Preconception Health
   - Postpartum Recovery
   - Holistic Living Tips
   - HTMA & Mineral Health

**Pin Title Formula:**
[Number] + [Adjective] + [Keyword] + [Promise]
- "7 Natural Ways to Balance Hormones with PCOS"
- "The Complete HTMA Guide for Women's Health"
- "Easy Hormone-Friendly Breakfast Ideas"

### Instagram Content Pillars

1. **Educational Carousels** (Save-worthy)
   - "5 Signs of Mineral Deficiency"
   - "PCOS Myths vs Facts"
   - "What I Eat in a Day (NP Edition)"

2. **Personal/Behind-the-Scenes** (Trust-building)
   - Day in my life
   - Family moments (with boundaries)
   - Why I do this work

3. **Tips & Quick Wins** (Shareable)
   - "One swap for better sleep"
   - "My morning routine"
   - "Supplement I can't live without"

4. **Client Wins/Testimonials** (Social proof)
   - Anonymized success stories
   - Before/after (with permission)
   - Review screenshots

### Blog-to-Social Repurposing Workflow

For every blog post, create:
```
1 Blog Post
    → 3-5 Pinterest pins
    → 1 Instagram carousel (key points)
    → 1 Instagram reel (30-60 sec summary)
    → 1 Facebook post with blog link
    → 3-5 Instagram stories (over the week)
    → 1 email newsletter feature
```

## Final Notes

Remember: SEO and AIO are long-term strategies. You won't see dramatic results in week one, but consistent effort compounds over time.

**The most important thing:** Keep creating helpful, authentic content that serves your audience. Your unique combination of clinical expertise and personal experience is your competitive advantage.

When in doubt, ask yourself: "Would this be the best resource on the internet for a woman searching for this information?"

If the answer is yes, you're on the right track.
