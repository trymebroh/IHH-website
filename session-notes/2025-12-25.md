### Cookie Consent & Google Consent Mode v2

**Cookie Consent Banner:**
- Slide-up banner appears 1 second after page load (if no prior consent)
- "Your Privacy Matters" heading with privacy policy link
- Accept button: Grants analytics consent, updates gtag, hides banner
- Decline button: Stores preference, hides banner (no tracking)
- ARIA accessibility: `role="dialog"`, proper label attributes

**Testing the Implementation:**

2. Banner appears after 1 second
3. Accept → localStorage shows `cookie_consent: accepted`, GA4 enabled
