# Session Notes - 2026-01-03

## Completed

### Branching Policy for Browser vs Local
Added branching guidance to `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`:
- Browser: push to `browser-coded-branch` first, then optionally `drafts-website-edits`
- Local VS Code: push to both `browser-coded-branch` and `drafts-website-edits`

### Browser-Only Workflow Docs
Added browser/local workflow and preview URL guidance to `WORKFLOW.md` and `README.md`.
Added a GitHub PR template for quick checks before merging.

### HTMA Testing Count Clarification
Answered user question about how many HTMA tests are included in each package:
- **Mineral Insights**: 1 HTMA test (initial only)
- **Intentional Reset**: 2 HTMA tests (initial + follow-up after 6-8 week integration)
- **Signature Program**: At least 1 (inherits from Mineral Insights), plus "additional labs as needed"

### Services URL Structure Fix (Option A)
Implemented cleaner URL structure so `/services` and `/services/` now work:

**Problem:** AIs and users looking for `/services` got 404 because actual file was `/services/services.html`

**Solution:** Renamed `services.html` → `index.html`
- Now `/services/` loads automatically (Netlify serves index.html)
- `/services` (no trailing slash) auto-redirects to `/services/`

**Files Updated (16 active site files):**
- `services/index.html` - canonical URL, og:url, breadcrumb, internal nav links
- All main pages, blog templates, legal pages, sitemap, netlify.toml, js/blog.js, CLAUDE.md

### GA4 Full Integration
Comprehensive Google Analytics 4 setup:

**Core Setup:**
- Key events marked: `form_submit`, `cta_click`, `newsletter_subscribe`
- Data retention extended to 14 months
- Google Signals enabled (demographics)
- Google Search Console created, linked, and sitemap submitted (12 pages discovered)

**GA4 API Access:**
- Created Google Cloud project: `IHH-Website-Analytics`
- Created service account: `ga4-reader@ihh-website-analytics.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- JSON key stored in Netlify env var: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
- Created Netlify function: `/.netlify/functions/ga4-analytics`
- Can now pull analytics on demand via API

**Enhanced Tracking (Priority 2):**
- Blog post tracking: title, slug, categories, author
- Form field tracking: start, field focus, abandonment analysis
- Scroll milestones: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- Time on page thresholds: 30s, 1min, 2min, 5min

**Funnels Created (Priority 3):**
- Lead Generation: Homepage → Services → PB Click
- Blog to Services: Blog → CTA Click → Services
- HTMA Interest: HTMA → Services → PB Click

**Audiences Created (Priority 4):**
- High Intent - No Conversion (visited services, didn't click PB)
- Blog Readers (viewed blog post)
- HTMA Interested (visited HTMA page)
- Practice Better Form Clicks (clicked PB intake link)

**Path Exploration:** Created reverse path from `cta_click` to see what journeys lead to conversions

- Top pages: Homepage (285), About (92), Blog (90+80), Services (77)
- Traffic sources: 86% direct, 3 from Facebook
- Peak day: Dec 31 (11 users)

## Pending / Follow-up (After Jan 5)

- Request indexing for key pages in Search Console
- Check Search Console Coverage report
- Check Search Console Performance report
- Collect 2-3 weeks of data before analyzing friction in lead booking process

## Notes

- Site redirects www → non-www; use `https://intentionholistichealth.com` as canonical
- Netlify Analytics cancelled recommendation (GA4 is free and more detailed)
- User concerned about friction in lead booking process - monitoring with analytics
- Apply page no longer actively used; conversions tracked at PB click level
- GitHub repo confirmed private

## Key Insight to Watch
User hypothesis: Lead booking process may have too much friction. Data points to monitor:
- Services → PB Click rate
- Time on Services page
- Scroll depth on Services (do they reach pricing?)
- Path exploration showing drop-off points
