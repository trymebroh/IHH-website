# Session Notes - 2026-01-03

## Completed

### HTMA Testing Count Clarification
Answered user question about how many HTMA tests are included in each package:
- **Mineral Insights**: 1 HTMA test (initial only)
- **Intentional Reset**: 2 HTMA tests (initial + follow-up after 6-8 week integration)
- **Signature Program**: At least 1 (inherits from Mineral Insights), plus "additional labs as needed"

### Services URL Structure Fix (Option A)
Implemented cleaner URL structure so `/services` and `/services/` now work:

**Problem:** AIs and users looking for `/services` got 404 because actual file was `/services/services.html`

**Solution:** Renamed `services.html` → `index.html`
- Now `/services/` loads automatically (Netlify serves index.html)
- `/services` (no trailing slash) auto-redirects to `/services/`

**Files Updated (16 active site files):**
- `services/index.html` - canonical URL, og:url, breadcrumb, internal nav links
- `index.html` - 6 internal links
- `about.html` - 6 internal links
- `contact.html` - 4 internal links
- `apply.html` - 4 internal links
- `htma.html` - 5 internal links
- `blog/post.html` - 5 internal links
- `blog/index.html` - 5 internal links
- `blog/post-superior.html` - 5 internal links
- `legal/terms.html` - 3 internal links
- `legal/privacy.html` - 3 internal links
- `legal/disclaimer.html` - 3 internal links
- `services/lab-review.html` - 5 internal links + breadcrumb schema
- `services/intentional-reset.html` - 4 internal links
- `sitemap.xml` - canonical URL
- `netlify.toml` - redirect target
- `js/blog.js` - 3 internal links in blog post content
- `CLAUDE.md` - documentation references

**Not Updated (intentionally):**
- Session notes (historical documentation)
- Archive folder (archived pages)
- Tasks folder (historical documentation)

### Option B Added to Future Todos
Added "Services Hub Page" to `/tasks/future-todos.md` under MEDIUM Priority:
- Create a true "choose your path" entry point at `/services/`
- Overview of 3-tier structure (Sessions, Packages, Programs)
- Move current packages content to `/services/packages.html`

## Files Changed

- `services/index.html` (renamed from services.html)
- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `contact.html`
- `apply.html`
- `htma.html`
- `blog/post.html`
- `blog/index.html`
- `blog/post-superior.html`
- `legal/terms.html`
- `legal/privacy.html`
- `legal/disclaimer.html`
- `services/lab-review.html`
- `services/intentional-reset.html`
- `sitemap.xml`
- `netlify.toml`
- `js/blog.js`
- `CLAUDE.md`

## Pending

- Connect GA4 tracking (user mentioned planning to do this morning)
- Consider Netlify API for form submission data (discussed but not implemented)

## Notes

- Netlify Analytics (detailed page-level data) requires paid add-on ($9/mo)
- GA4 remains the better choice for visitor analytics (free, more detailed)
- Netlify API could be useful for pulling form submissions as backup
