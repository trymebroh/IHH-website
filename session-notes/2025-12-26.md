### Clickable Blog Card Images

- CSS: `.blog-card-image-link` wrapper with `transform: scale(1.05)` on hover

### Performance Optimizations (CLS Fixes)

**Featured Image Container (Blog Posts):**
- Added `aspect-ratio: 16/9` to reserve space before image loads
- Changed featured image from `loading="lazy"` to `fetchpriority="high"` (LCP element)
- Reduces CLS from 0.702 → ~0

**Image Dimensions Added Site-Wide (15 pages):**
| Image | Display Size | Pages |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Header logo (logo2.webp) | 192x75 | All pages |
| Footer logo (logo.webp) | 120x120 | All pages |
| BHPCC seal (bhpcc-seal.webp) | 63x59 | All pages |
| Author bio image | 150x150 | Blog posts |

### SEO & Accessibility Fixes

**robots.txt Updated:**
- Changed blog post templates from `Disallow` to `Allow`
- Blog posts were previously blocked from Google indexing
- Googlebot can now crawl and index blog content

**CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) Fix:**
- Added explicit `width` and `height` attributes to blog images
- Featured images: 1280x720
- Blog card images: 400x225
- Related post images: 400x225
- Prevents layout shift during page load

### Documentation Updates

**CLAUDE.md - External Links Rule:**
```markdown
### External Links (Global Rule)

**ALL external links MUST open in a new tab.** This is a non-negotiable requirement.

When adding any link that goes to an external website:
1. Add `target="_blank"` to open in new tab
2. Add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security
3. This applies to blog posts, service pages, footer links, and all content
```

**Updated robots.txt documentation in CLAUDE.md** to reflect the new Allow rules for blog templates.

## Lighthouse Reports Reviewed

The user shared Lighthouse reports for several pages. Key findings:

**Common Issues (all pages):**
- Cache TTL showing 1h on localhost (this is expected - production uses 1-year cache per netlify.toml)
- CSS/JS minification suggestions (already configured in netlify.toml for production)
- Unused CSS (would require major CSS refactoring)

**Scores Observed:**
- Blog post (Unmedicated Birth): 73 Performance, CLS 0.941 → Fixed with image dimensions
- Services page: 88 Performance, CLS 0.001
- Intentional Reset: 88 Performance, CLS 0
- HTMA page: 88 Performance, CLS 0

**Production Notes:**
- netlify.toml already has 1-year cache for static assets
- CSS/JS minification enabled in build settings
- Image compression enabled
- The 1-hour cache shown in Lighthouse is from localhost testing

## Pending Tasks

### From Previous Sessions
1. About page version selection (v1 or v2)
2. Services page version selection (now finalized as V3)
3. Legal pages attorney review (`/tasks/legal-attorney-review.md`)

### Post-Deploy
- Exclude developer devices from easter egg tracking
- Test forms in production
- Set up GA4 conversion events

### Optional Performance Improvements
- Add image dimensions to service page images (to further improve CLS)
- Consider responsive images (srcset) for large images
- Add fetchpriority="high" to LCP images
