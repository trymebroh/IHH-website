- **Fixed file permissions** - CSS, JS, HTML, images, and fonts were set to 644; directories set to 755 to ensure http-server can serve all assets

## Pending

- Review blog images - some posts reference placeholder images that may need updating
- Consider adding actual publication dates from the live site (if available)
- Test all blog category filtering functionality

## Notes

- Blog content is stored in `js/blog.js` as a `BLOG_POSTS` array rather than separate markdown files
- The permission issue occurred because file edits can reset permissions to restrictive defaults (600)
- Process graphic was added to homepage in a previous session
