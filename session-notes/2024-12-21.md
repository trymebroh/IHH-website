# Session Notes - December 21, 2024

## Completed

- **Updated all 7 blog posts with real content** from Alicia's live Kajabi website:
  1. Holiday Wellness for Women: Staying Grounded Without Extremes
  2. How I Prepared for an Unmedicated Birth (6 preparation methods)
  3. Your Body Is the First Home (6 preconception foundations)
  4. May is Mental Health Awareness Month (PCOS statistics + 9 practical tips)
  5. Recipe: Probiotic-Rich Smoothie Bowl
  6. Gut Health and PCOS: The Missing Piece of the Puzzle
  7. Recipe: Hormone-Friendly Granola

- **Fixed file permissions** - CSS, JS, HTML, images, and fonts were set to 644; directories set to 755 to ensure http-server can serve all assets

## Pending

- Review blog images - some posts reference placeholder images that may need updating
- Consider adding actual publication dates from the live site (if available)
- Test all blog category filtering functionality

## Notes

- Blog content is stored in `js/blog.js` as a `BLOG_POSTS` array rather than separate markdown files
- The permission issue occurred because file edits can reset permissions to restrictive defaults (600)
- Process graphic was added to homepage in a previous session
