## Quick Reference

### Semantic HTML Heading Hierarchy

Correct structure used across service pages:
```
<section>
  <h2>Section Title</h2>        <!-- Main section heading -->
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Card Title</h3>          <!-- For standalone cards -->
    <!-- OR -->
    <h4>Card Title</h4>          <!-- For cards within subsections -->
  </div>
</section>
```

### Compliant Disclaimer Template

Use this structure for all service/educational pages:
```html
<section class="v2-disclaimer v2-disclaimer-compliant">
  <div class="container">
    <h4 class="v2-disclaimer-title">Educational & Imagery Disclaimer</h4>
    <p>[Educational purpose statement - customize per page type]</p>
    <p>[Imagery disclosure - standard across all pages]</p>
    <p><strong>Scope of Services:</strong> [Scope statement - customize per page]</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Notes for Next Session

- The new hero image (D08A6867.jpg) is a full-size JPG - should be converted to WebP with srcset variants for optimal performance
- Consider running Lighthouse audit after these changes to ensure no performance regression
- Review the featured service card layout on various screen sizes
