# Session Notes - 2026-01-04

## Completed
- Added blog input preferences to `AGENTS.md` to cover plain-text-only inputs, default suggestions with confirmation, and WebP conversion for non-WebP blog images.
- Updated `tasks/todo.md` with a completed current task plan and review summary.

### DNS/Email Deliverability Check
- Checked DNS records for `intentionholistichealth.com` via Google DNS API
- **SPF**: ✅ Set up (`v=spf1 a mx include:_spf.mlsend.com ?all`)
- **MailerLite verification**: ✅ Set up (TXT record found)
- **DMARC**: ❌ Not found (optional, improves security)
- **DKIM CNAME**: ❌ Not found (optional, improves deliverability)
- Current setup (CNAME + 2 TXTs) should work for sending

### Accounts Inventory Update
- Updated `/docs/accounts-inventory.md`:
  - Added Netlify DNS to hosting section
  - Added sender email: `alicia.harrison@intentionholistichealth.com`
  - Added domain authentication note (CNAME + 2 TXT records configured)

### FAQPage Schema Added
- Added FAQPage structured data to remaining service pages:
  - `/services/lab-review.html` - 4 FAQs
  - `/services/intentional-reset.html` - 6 FAQs
- Note: `/services/index.html` and `/htma.html` already had FAQPage schema
- Google can now display FAQ rich results for all service pages

## Pending
- None.

## Notes
- User requested future blog requests be handled with plain-text inputs only and auto-suggested defaults requiring confirmation.
- MailerLite domain authentication is working with basic setup; DMARC/DKIM are optional enhancements if deliverability issues arise.
