# Legal Language Attorney Review - Future Task

**Created:** December 25, 2025
**Status:** Pending attorney consultation
**Priority:** HIGH - Complete before final terminology replacements

---

## Purpose

Before implementing terminology changes on legal pages, consult with an attorney to ensure:
1. Proper legal language for service descriptions
2. Compliance with Kentucky nursing/telehealth regulations
3. Proper disclaimers for digital products and educational content

---

## Pages Requiring Attorney Review

### legal/terms.html

Current instances of prohibited terminology:
- Section 11: "Results from **coaching** or wellness recommendations"
- Section 2.1: "Wellness **consultations**" (list item)

**Questions for attorney:**
- Should "coaching" be replaced with "wellness support" or another term?
- Should "consultations" be replaced, or is this acceptable legal language?
- What language is appropriate for digital products/educational content availability?

### legal/privacy.html

Current instances:
- Section 2.1 heading: "Personal Information (Website or **Coaching** Services)"
- Body text: "non-clinical **coaching** services" (2 occurrences)
- Section 3.1 heading: "To Provide **Coaching** or Website Services"
- List item: "Provide non-clinical **coaching** services"

**Questions for attorney:**
- What replacement term is appropriate for privacy policy language?
- Does changing terminology affect any legal protections?

### legal/disclaimer.html

Current instances:
- Section 3 heading: "Health **Coaching** Distinction"
- Body text: "**coaching** offerings provided through"

**Questions for attorney:**
- Is "Health Coaching Distinction" section still needed if coaching terminology is removed?
- What replacement language maintains proper legal distinction?

## Additional Questions for Attorney

1. **Digital products and educational content:** Can these be offered to anyone regardless of location, or must they also be Kentucky-only?

2. **Service categories:** With section 2.2 removed from terms.html, should there be any mention of educational/informational content?

3. **Terminology consistency:** Should legal pages use identical terminology to user-facing pages, or is legal-specific language acceptable?
