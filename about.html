    <!-- My Story Section -->

          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>
            My passion for holistic health began in childhood, watching my grandfather manage Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes through dietary and lifestyle interventions. Seeing the power of intentional choices on health outcomes planted a seed that would grow throughout my career.
          </p>
          <p>
            After earning my Bachelor's in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing, I spent years working in critical care. While I loved the intensity of that environment, I became increasingly frustrated watching preventable conditions land patients in the ICU. I saw firsthand how our conventional healthcare system often waits until crisis strikes instead of addressing root causes early.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came my own health struggles—fatigue that coffee couldn't fix, skin issues that creams couldn't clear, and sleep problems that left me feeling depleted. My labs looked "normal," but I knew something was off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my personal healing journey, I discovered how deeply our hormones are impacted by metabolism, stress, nutrition, and daily habits. I completed additional specialized training in nutrition and HTMA (Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis) interpretation, which opened my eyes to a whole new way of understanding the body.

        <div class="about-section">
          <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            I believe that many women's symptoms are dismissed as "normal" when they actually signal underlying dysfunction. Fatigue isn't just part of being a busy mom. Irregular cycles aren't just "stress." Brain fog isn't something you have to live with.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to help you feel supported, educated, and empowered—so healthy habits actually stick, without the overwhelm. I'm passionate about connecting symptoms to root causes through understanding your daily rhythms, nourishment, and non-toxic living.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work alongside women with their primary care providers, supporting them through preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum phases. My role isn't to replace your doctor—it's to fill the gaps that conventional medicine often leaves behind.

            <div>
              <p><strong>Family:</strong> I'm married to my husband Kyle James, and we welcomed our son Lucas James in 2024. Our family also includes two doodles named Beckett and Murray who keep life interesting.</p>
